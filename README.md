# todo-app-mvp

_This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)._

[160 LOC (lines of code)](https://github.com/codex-zaydek/todo-app-mvp/blob/master/src/TodoApp/TodoApp.js) to demonstrate how I would author a MVP (minimum viable product) todo app in React. Note that this app has **no** styling and is purely functional.

I typically use `uuid/v4` to generate UUIDS (universally unique identifier) on the fly and `use-immer` to author reducers using a mutative API (as opposed to a functional API).
