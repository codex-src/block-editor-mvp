# todo-app-mvp

[160 LOC](https://github.com/codex-zaydek/todo-app-mvp/blob/master/src/TodoApp/TodoApp.js) to demonstrate how I would author a MVP todo app in React. Note that this app has _no_ styling and is purely functional.

I typically use `uuid/v4` to generate UUIDS on the fly and `use-immer` to author reducers using a mutative API.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
